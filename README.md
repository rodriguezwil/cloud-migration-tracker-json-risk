# ☁️ Cloud Migration Tracker + Risk Governance Dashboard

This project is a **real-world simulation** of a cloud migration portfolio tracker and risk analysis dashboard built in **Power BI**, powered by structured JSON data parsing and visual storytelling.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This dashboard helps organizations:

- Track cloud migration initiatives by **CAF domain**, **phase**, and **milestone**
- Visualize project **status and workload distribution**
- Parse and break down embedded **risk data** (from JSON blobs) into clear, actionable categories

## 📊 Key Visuals

- **CAF Domain Breakdown** – Projects by Cloud Adoption Framework domain
- **Milestone Progress Chart**
- **Risk Severity Breakdown** (pie chart)
- **Clean Project Summary Table**
